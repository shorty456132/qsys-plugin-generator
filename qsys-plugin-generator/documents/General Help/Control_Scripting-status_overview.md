# Status

This topic provides a comprehensive overview of the status control, detailing how the Status LED and Status box use both color and text to indicate the current condition of the device. Additionally, this topic covers the meaning behind the control pins, explaining their values, string positions, and the available pins.

### Controls

Component status is conveyed with the Status LED and Status box, which uses both color and text to indicate the current condition:

* **OK**: The device is functioning normally.
* **Initializing**: The device is in the process of a firmware, patch, or configuration update, or the design is starting.
* **Compromised**: The device is functioning, but a non-fatal problem exists. Refer to the Status box for details.
* **Missing**: The device cannot be discovered.
* **Fault**: The device is malfunctioning or is not properly configured. Refer to the Status box for details.
* **Unknown**: This status appears during a Core reboot (for example, during a firmware update), or when a design is being uploaded to the Core and before it has started running.
* **Not Present**: If applicable to the device, this status appears when the device is not connected to the network and its Is Required component property is set to 'No'. This status also appears if the device component's Dynamically Paired property is set to 'Yes', pairing has not been assigned in Core Manager, and the device component's Is Required property is set to 'Yes'. See [Dynamic Pairing](../Core_Manager/System_Management/Dynamic_Pairing.htm).
